My role as instructor is to introduce you to new methods, tools, and techniques, but it is up to you to take them and make use of them. A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each lecture and lab. You are expected to prepare for class by completing assigned readings, attend all lecture sessions, and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussion. Additionally, some lectures will feature application exercises that will be graded based on completing what we do in class.\nYou are expected to bring a laptop, tablet, or Chromebook to each class so that you can participate in the in-class exercises. Please make sure your device is fully charged before you come to class, as the number of outlets in the classroom may not be sufficient to accommodate everyone.",

    "section": "Activities & Assessment",
    "text": "Activities & Assessment\nYou will be assessed based on four components: application exercises, homework, project, and oral exams.\n\nApplication Exercises\nMost lectures will have Application Exercises (AEs) that go along with them. These exercises will give you an opportunity to practice applying the statistical concepts and code introduced in the readings and lectures. Typically, students who are present will receive full credit on AEs and do not need to turn anything in. However, there will be times where you must complete an AE outside of class and submit it. Students who are late to class or miss class entirely must turn in a .qmd and .pdf file for their AE before the start of the next lecture. Specifically, AEs from Monday lectures are due Tuesday by 1:00pm MT. Students with an excused absence will be graded for completion, students without an excused absence will be graded for correctness.\n\n\nHomework\nIn homework, you will apply what you’ve learned during lecture to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Similar to lab assignments, homework must be typed up using Quarto and submitted as .qmd and .pdf files in Canvas.\n\n\nOral Exams\nThere will be two oral exams in this course. Each exam will include a closed-notes component and an applied component which uses R. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far. The exams will focus on both conceptual understanding of the content and application through analysis and computational tasks. The content of the exam will be related to the content in reading assignments, lectures, application exercises, and homework assignments. More detail about the exams will be given during the semester. Please note the following course policies:\n\nYou MUST receive at least an average of 60% on your exams to pass the class.\nStudents will an average lower than 70% may retake one of their oral exams but will be capped at 70% for their exam grade.\nANY UNCITED CODE ON YOUR HOMEWORK WHICH IS NOT COVERED IN CLASS IS ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION IN YOUR ORAL EXAM.\nThe R used on the exams will be basic. The purpose of including R is to ensure you know the basic R functions we use regularly, R syntax, and your R “workflow”. Do you know the basic functions? If you run into a (common) error, can you debug it yourself? Can you interpret the R Help menu? Do you understand common terminology (e.g. “argument”, “function”, “output”)?\nThe specific questions asked during the Oral Exams will be different for every student and for every attempt, although similar in style and difficulty.\n\n\n\nProject\nThe purpose of the final project is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-driven research question. The project will be completed with your in pairs, and each team will present their work through a written report and poster presentation taking place during the last day of class. More information about the project will be provided during the semester.",

I will help you by providing you with materials and answering questions and setting a pace, but for this to work you must do the following:\n\nComplete all the preparation work before class.\nAsk questions. As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask why. If you’re not sure about the homework, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo the readings.\nDo the homework. The earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example.)\nDon’t procrastinate. The content builds upon what was taught in previous weeks, so if something is confusing to you on Day 2, Day 3 will become more confusing, Day 4 even worse, etc. Don’t let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours and I can help you identify a good (re)starting point.",

    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\n\nThe homework assignments must be completed individually but you are welcome to discuss the assignment with classmates (e.g., discuss what’s the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share (i.e. via copy/paste or copying) answers to homework questions (including and especially any code) with anyone other than myself.\nFor the projects, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project across teams.\nReusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. Furthermore, ANY UNCITED CODE OR CONTENT ON YOUR HOMEWORK WHICH IS NOT COVERED IN CLASS IS ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION IN YOUR ORAL EXAMS.\nUse of artificial intelligence (AI): You should treat AI tools, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources. There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:1 (1) Cognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning. (2) Ethical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\nAI tools for code: You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. You may use these guidelines for citing AI-generated content.\nNo AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, AI is not permitted for writing narrative on assignments. In general, you may use AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.\n\n\nIf you are unsure if the use of a particular resource complies with the academic honesty policy, please ask.\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all College of Idaho policies, including academic integrity (e.g., completing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, adhering to guidance around group work projects, and more). Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Honor Code.\n\n\nLate work policy\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. I understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline.\n\nLate Homework: There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late for the first two days. After 2 days, students will receive a 30% reduction. No homework will be accepted after it is returned to the class\nLate Application Exercises: AEs are due the day after the class they are assigned. No late work is accepted for application exercises, since these are designed as in-class activities to help you prepare for homework.\nSchool-Sponsored Events/Illness: If an application exercise, exam, or project must be missed due to a school-sponsored event, you must let me know at least a week ahead of time so that we can schedule a time for you to make up the work before you leave. If you must miss a exam or a project presentation due to illness, you must let me know before class that day so that we can schedule a time for you to take a make-up quiz or exam. Failure to adhere to this policy will result in a 35% penalty on the corresponding assignment.\n\n\n\nRegrade Requests\nRegrade requests must be submitted via email within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the final project presentations.",

    "section": "Quarto",
    "text": "Quarto\nThe thing you are reading right now is an Quarto document (very similar to R Markdown if you’ve ever used that). Quarto runs inside R Studio. Quarto is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages, word documents, pdfs, and many more file types. You can find the link to a useful Quarto guide here.\nWhen you click the Render button at the top of this window an html file will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. Not only can you embed the R code, you can embed the output produced by the R code. In this way, your analysis is fully reproducible and updatable. All of your homework assignments must be prepared using Quarto.\nThe nice thing about Quarto is that you can write prose (as I am doing now), mathematical equations using LaTeX syntax (like \\(y_i = a + b x_i\\)), and R code/output/plots all in one synthesized document. This makes it approximately 10,000 times easier to use than doing the same thing in Word or LaTeX. As you go through this introduction, I recommend that you look also at the .qmd file and your output file side-by-side to get an idea of how Quarto works. (Since you’re going to have to use Quarto this semester, you might as well start learning it now!)\nIn the future, I will typically give you a Quarto template to fill out. However, occasionally you will need to create your own Quarto document. When you want to start a new Quarto document, click “File &gt; New File &gt; Quarto Document…” Put yourself as author, and make sure to give it a descriptive title!\n\nExercise 1\nClick Render at the top of this document. Show Dr. Friedlander before moving on."

    "text": "Using R as a Calculator and Running Code within a Quarto Document\nWith R by your side, you will never need your TI-84 again. Consider the simple arithmetic in the chunk below. You can run this code chunk all at once by clicking the Run button, the sideways green arrow in the top right of the chunk. Notice the interactive nature of the output. You can click through to see the different pieces of output.\nAs you work through this document, you should Run each chunk as you come to it.\n\nExercise 2\nRun the code chunk below.\n\n5 + 3\n\n[1] 8\n\n5.3 * 23.4\n\n[1] 124.02\n\nsqrt(16) # this is a comment.  R will not 'see' anything past a #, but you can use it to explain your code\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nLook closely at how Quarto denotes the R code and the output. Also note in the .qmd file how I include R code as separate from prose. These are called “chunks”. The easiest way to add a new chunk is to click on the green “c” icon with a plus in the corner above, then choose “R”. R code that is not inside of a chunk will not be run by Quarto!\n\n\nExercise 3\nCreate an R code chunk and compute the log of 10 using the function log. Why do you think the answer isn’t 1?\n\n\nExercise 4\nYou can also save values to named variables, to be used later:\n\nproduct &lt;- 15.3 * 23.4 #save result\n\nIf you save something like this, R will not show the output unless you expressly ask for it:\n\nproduct #show result\n\n[1] 358.02\n\n\nThe symbol “&lt;-” is the assignment operator. If you’ve ever programmed before, it’s essentially the same as “=” in this instance. There are cases where “&lt;-” works and “=” doesn’t, so it’s good to get into the habit of using “&lt;-” now.\nOnce variables are defined, they can be referenced with other operators and functions. Try executing each line of code individually by placing your cursor on the first line of the chunk below and pressing Ctrl+Enter (Cmd +Enter for Mac users); then do the same for the second line. (This is how you can run a single line within a larger chunk.)\n\n.5 * product # half of the product\n\n[1] 179.01\n\nproduct^(1/4) # fourth root of the product\n\n[1] 4.349875\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5\nYou can also use in-line R code in Quarto, which can be useful when calling defined variables. Did you know that the natural log of 358.02 is 5.8805889?\n\n\nExercise 6\nOnly R code (and comments) should be inside chunks. Prose (interpretations/explanations/descriptions) should never be put inside a chunk; prose should be below or above the chunk, as I have done above (and continue to do throughout this document). You should also never cut-and-paste output or graphs into the chunks. The whole point of code chunks is that they contain the code and they’ll run the code (resulting in the output and/or graphs).\nIf you want to run something in R but don’t want it to appear in the Quarto document, simply run it in the Console in the lower-left quadrant of RStudio. Type the last line of R code above into the Console and see what happens."

The Dietary Guidelines for America recommend that carbohydrates make up 45% to 65% of total daily calories. Our goal is to understand the relationship between the amount of carbohydrates and calories in Starbucks food items. We’d also like to assess if the relationship differs based on the type of food item (bakery, salad, sandwich, etc.)\nYou will now be introduced to the functions we will use most frequently for exploratory data analysis (EDA) in this class. If you are moderate to advanced R user, feel free to use whatever functions you’d like to accomplish the tasks. However, you should be prepared to answer questions about any uncited code which is not covered in this class on your oral exams. The first part of this document contains explanations for beginning R users, but all students should work through the entire document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn general, I suggest “rendering as you go”: rendering every few chunks, to make sure things are rendering correctly, rather than waiting until the end of a document to render the whole thing (and potentially encountering lots of errors that you have to unpack)! I also ALWAYS suggest “saving as you go”: it’s a good idea to save every couple of minutes. (This is good practice for all your files.)\n\n\n\nExercise 7\nThe code below loads the package called tidyverse which provides many functions that will be useful for manipulating data and the package called mosaic which is useful for teaching statistics. Add another line that loads a package called ggformula which we will use to plot our data and a third that loads the package openintro which will contain our data for this activity. Note that #| warning: FALSE causes the code to run without displaying any associated warnings when you render. You will often see #| eval: FALSE which prevents the code chunk from running when you render the document. Throughout this course, make sure you remove these lines or change them to #| eval: TRUE whenever you reach them. The reason that are included in the first place is so I can write scaffolded and fill-in-the-blank type exercises for you.

The pseudo-code below is going to be our foundation for the rest of the class:\nfunction( Y ~ X, data = DataSetName )\nHere’s a short description of each part in the pseudo-code above:\n\nfunction is an R function that dictates something you want to do with your data; for example,\n\nmean calculates the mean\nlm fits a linear regression model\n\nY is the outcome of interest (response variable)\nX is some explanatory variable; you can use 1 as a placeholder if there is no explanatory variable\nDataSetName is the name of a data set loaded into the R environment\n\nAlways start with clear research questions. Our question for this exercise:\n\nHow do the number of carbs compare for bakery and non-bakery items?\n\nThe purpose of the exploratory data analysis (EDA) is to learn as much as you can about your research question before doing any statistical modeling. We basically want to try and answer the research question with EDA if possible…or at least have a guess as to what the answer “should” be. Then we use statistical models to formally accommodate variability in the data and calculate the uncertainty of our conclusions.\n\nExercise 12\nUse the R code chunk below to calculate the mean carbs by for bakery and non-bakery items. Summarize your observations below the code chunk.\n\nmean(carb ~ bakery, data = starbucks)\n\n\n\nExercise 13\nOf course, there are lots of other ways to summarize a numerical variable besides the mean. Use the R code chunk to calculate the other summary statistics for the number of carbs for bakery and non-bakery items using the function favstats. Summarize your observations below the code chunk.\n(Hint: Do you not know how favstats works? Well, it’s a function just like any other: it follows the syntax described at the top of this section! Also, you can always find details and examples by searching the Help menu in the lower-right quadrant.)\n\n\nExercise 14\nLet’s generate some univariate (i.e. one-variable) EDA plots for our three variables. In general, can use histograms or boxplots (gf_histogram or gf_boxplot) for quantitative variables and bar charts gf_bar for categorical variables. Fill in the blanks in the code below to generate the corresponding plots. Then create a boxplot of carb. Finally, share your observations below the code:\n\n# make a histogram of carb\ngf_histogram(~ carb, data = starbucks)\n\n# make a histogram of calories\ngf_histgoram(~ _____, data = ______)\n\n# make a bar chart of bakery\ngf_bar(~ _____, data = _____)\n\n# make a boxplot of carb\n\n\n\nExercise 15\nLet’s not generate some bivariate (i.e. two-variable) EDA plots for our three variables. For two-quantitative variables we typically use a scatter plot gf_point. If we are comparing a quantitative and a categorical variable will use side-by-side boxplots gf_boxplot. Generate and plot to visualize carb and calories and one to visualize carb and bakery. Comment on your observations."

The purpose of the peer-review is to identify areas of the paper in which communication of statistical ideas needs to be improved. You may also offer suggestions for additional statistical analysis or ideas for future research, but it is not your goal to critique or criticize the analyses that have already been completed (the professor will provide guidance in this aspect). As a reviewer, it is NOT your job to correct spelling or grammatical mistakes. It is also NOT your job to offer precise rewording of sentences or phrases, just to point out where such rephrasing could occur. Your feedback will be provided to the author in a separate typed document. For your assigned manuscript, follow this procedure:\n\nYou will be assigned a manuscript to peer review through the Stage III assignment on Canvas.\nRead the manuscript, noting confusing things (underline, circle, write notes in the margins, etc.). On the first read-through, focus on getting the MAIN IDEA of the paper.\n\nRe-read the manuscript. Now specifically focus on the confusing parts, and see if you can figure them out. Maybe the author needs to explain things in a better order? or use less jargon? Is the writing style professional, concise, precise, and understandable? Write down these comments.\nRe-read, focusing on each section of the paper (the “Revising Guide” will probably help here). Does it include the necessary items listed in the Project Report Section of the project instruction? Are all things in the correct sections? Is all relevant information provided?\nAre figures/graphs/tables well-labeled and understandable?\nSummarize your comments in a typed document using the “Revising Guide” as a… well… guide. The most helpful feedback will consider the paper from two perspectives:\n\nGeneral comments about structure and style.\nSpecific comments about confusing sentences, missing info, etc. For specific comments, please include page number and line or paragraph number. Your comments may be phrased as questions (“What is the implication of XXX being statistically significant?”). Alternatively, you may offer suggestions (“Page 3, paragraph 4: It might clarify what you mean if you explain XXX before this point, rather than waiting until page 5. I found I had to flip between pages to understand your point.”) or general comments (“I don’t understand the first sentence of paragraph 5 on page 6.”).\n\nTurn in the typed document (“Revising Guide” with comments) to the Stage IV Canvas assignment and email it to the author. If you’ve written comments on the physical draft, give that back to the author as well."

    "text": "Stage IV.V: Self-review\n\nWhen your story is ready for rewrite, cut it to the bone. Get rid of every ounce of excess fat. This is going to hurt; revising a story down to the bare essentials is always a little like murdering children, but it must be done. —Stephen King\n\nIt will be helpful, after having a few days away from your paper, to review it using the “Revising Guide”. Try to look at it with fresh eyes. Read it aloud. Convince a friend/significant other/family member to listen to you read it. Encourage them to interrupt you when they don’t understand something or the writing is unclear. Interrupt yourself when you don’t understand something or the writing is unclear. Make notes to yourself about changes you should make: things you should add or delete from the paper, ways to make it more clear or more concise, etc. (You may not want to start making those changes until you read the professor and peer feedback.)"

By that time you begin to clearly and logically perceive what it is you really want to say. —Mark Twain\n\n\nRead carefully through the comment documents you received from peers and professor review. Consider also your self-review.\nMake thoughtful, liberal (and possibly painful) changes to your paper.\nMarvel at how much better (and probably shorter) your paper is.\nProvide responses to each comment document. For this, I recommend just adding your response under each point-by-point comment in each document. Make sure your responses are in a different color font than the reviewer’s, so I can tell the different between the reviewer’s comments and your responses. In some cases, the response may be as simple as “change was made.” For others, (particularly comments you choose to ignore), you may provide context or reasoning. (e.g. “I chose not to include a graph of blah versus blah because of space issues. However, I now comment on the relationship between blah and blah in paragraph 2 of page 4.”)\nSubmit the following on Canvas by the due date:\n\nthe final paper\nthe Annotated Appendix, as described in the Project Guidelines. (Even if you have not made any changes to the Appendix, upload it along with the paper.)\nthe peer feedback you received, with your response to comments included\nthe professor feedback you received, with your response to comments included"

That means that you should be spending approximately 9 hours per day working on this course (i.e. 6.5 hours outside of class)"
