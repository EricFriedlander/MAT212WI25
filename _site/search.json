    "text": "An introduction to statistical modeling and methods. Topics may include model construction and analysis using multiple linear regression, analysis of variance, and logistic regression. The course makes substantial use of statistical software. Students who have taken more than one calculus course should generally take MAT-212 rather than MAT-125.\n\n\n\nWe will cover approaches for analyzing multivariate data sets, emphasizing linear and logistic regression. You will learn techniques for checking the appropriateness of proposed models, such as residual analyses, and techniques for selecting models. You will gain experience dealing with the challenges that arise in practice through assignments that utilize real-world data. This class emphasizes data analysis over mathematical theory."

    "text": "Instructor\nEric is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Physical Sciences at the College of Idaho. His expertise lies in the areas of probability, statistics, and statistics education. He joined the College of Idaho faculty in 2024 after spending three years as an Assistant Professor at St. Norbert College in De Pere, Wisconsin. He received his bachelor’s degree in mathematics and statistics from Rice University in 2011. After earning his degree, he worked for Capital One for two years in their home loans division before enrolling in graduate school. In 2018, Eric received his Ph.D. in statistics and operations research from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill studying under professor Amarjit Budhiraja. His dissertation work focused on modeling and analyzing large systems which arise in industrial engineering (e.g. large server and communication networks). Following his Ph.D., Eric did a postdoc in the Department of Ecology & Evolution at the University of Chicago under the direction of professor Matthias Steinrücken where he used stochastic processes to study natural selection and population genetics.\nOutside of school, Eric is an avid fan of the New York Giants, New York Knicks, and North Carolina Tarheels. In addition, he enjoys comic books, the Fast and the Furious franchise, and spending time with his lovely wife Maria and lovable dogs Allie, Tony, and Miriam.\n\n\n\nOffice hours (Boone 126B)\n\n\n\n\n\nMTWRF\n10:30-11:30am\n\n\nor by appointment."
