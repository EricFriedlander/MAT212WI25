My role as instructor is to introduce you to new methods, tools, and techniques, but it is up to you to take them and make use of them. A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each lecture and lab. You are expected to prepare for class by completing assigned readings, attend all lecture sessions, and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussion. Additionally, some lectures will feature application exercises that will be graded based on completing what we do in class.\nYou are expected to bring a laptop, tablet, or Chromebook to each class so that you can participate in the in-class exercises. Please make sure your device is fully charged before you come to class, as the number of outlets in the classroom may not be sufficient to accommodate everyone.",

    "section": "Activities & Assessment",
    "text": "Activities & Assessment\nYou will be assessed based on four components: application exercises, homework, projects, and oral exams.\n\nApplication Exercises\nMost lectures will have Application Exercises (AEs) that go along with them. These exercises will give you an opportunity to practice applying the statistical concepts and code introduced in the readings and lectures. Typically, students who are present will receive full credit on AEs and do not need to turn anything in. However, there will be times where you must complete an AE outside of class and submit it. Students who are late to class or miss class entirely must turn in a .qmd and .pdf file for their AE before the start of the next lecture. Specifically, AEs from Monday lectures are due Tuesday by 1:00pm MT. Students with an excused absence will be graded for completion, students without an excused absence will be graded for correctness.\n\n\nHomework\nIn homework, you will apply what you’ve learned during lecture to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Similar to lab assignments, homework must be typed up using Quarto and submitted as .qmd and .pdf files in Canvas.\n\n\nOral Exams\nThere will be two oral exams in this course. Each exam will include a closed-notes component and an applied component which uses R. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far. The exams will focus on both conceptual understanding of the content and application through analysis and computational tasks. The content of the exam will be related to the content in reading assignments, lectures, application exercises, and homework assignments. More detail about the exams will be given during the semester. Please note the following course policies:\n\nYou MUST receive at least an average of 60% on your exams to pass the class.\nStudents will an average lower than 70% may retake one of their oral exams but will be capped at 70% for their exam grade.\nANY UNCITED CODE ON YOUR HOMEWORK WHICH IS NOT COVERED IN CLASS IS ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION IN YOUR ORAL EXAM.\nThe R used on the exams will be basic. The purpose of including R is to ensure you know the basic R functions we use regularly, R syntax, and your R “workflow”. Do you know the basic functions? If you run into a (common) error, can you debug it yourself? Can you interpret the R Help menu? Do you understand common terminology (e.g. “argument”, “function”, “output”)?\nThe specific questions asked during the Oral Exams will be different for every student and for every attempt, although similar in style and difficulty.\n\n\n\nProjects\nThere will be two projects this term. One for linear regression and one for logistic regression. The purpose of these projects is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze interesting data-driven research questions. The projects will be completed in pairs, and each team will present their work through a written report and poster presentation. More information about the projects will be provided during the semester.",

I will help you by providing you with materials and answering questions and setting a pace, but for this to work you must do the following:\n\nComplete all the preparation work before class.\nAsk questions. As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask why. If you’re not sure about the homework, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo the readings.\nDo the homework. The earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example.)\nDon’t procrastinate. The content builds upon what was taught in previous weeks, so if something is confusing to you on Day 2, Day 3 will become more confusing, Day 4 even worse, etc. Don’t let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours and I can help you identify a good (re)starting point.",

    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\n\nThe homework assignments must be completed individually but you are welcome to discuss the assignment with classmates (e.g., discuss what’s the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share (i.e. via copy/paste or copying) answers to homework questions (including and especially any code) with anyone other than myself.\nFor the projects, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project across teams.\nReusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. Furthermore, ANY UNCITED CODE ON YOUR HOMEWORK WHICH IS NOT COVERED IN CLASS IS ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION IN YOUR ORAL EXAMS.\nUse of artificial intelligence (AI): You should treat AI tools, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources. There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:1 (1) Cognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning. (2) Ethical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\nAI tools for code: You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. You may use these guidelines for citing AI-generated content.\nNo AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, AI is not permitted for writing narrative on assignments. In general, you may use AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.\n\n\nIf you are unsure if the use of a particular resource complies with the academic honesty policy, please ask.\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all College of Idaho policies, including academic integrity (e.g., completing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, adhering to guidance around group work projects, and more). Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Honor Code.\n\n\nLate work policy\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. I understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline.\n\nLate Homework: There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late for the first two days. After 2 days, students will receive a 30% reduction. No homework will be accepted after it is returned to the class\nLate Application Exercises: AEs are due the day after the class they are assigned. No late work is accepted for application exercises, since these are designed as in-class activities to help you prepare for homework.\nSchool-Sponsored Events/Illness: If an application exercise, exam, or final project must be missed due to a school-sponsored event, you must let me know at least a week ahead of time so that we can schedule a time for you to make up the work before you leave. If you must miss a exam or a project presentation due to illness, you must let me know before class that day so that we can schedule a time for you to take a make-up quiz or exam. Failure to adhere to this policy will result in a 35% penalty on the corresponding assignment.\n\n\n\nRegrade Requests\nRegrade requests must be submitted via email within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the final project presentations.",

A lot of questions are most effectively answered in-person, so office hours are a valuable resource. I encourage you to take advantage of them!\nMake a pledge to stop by office hours at least once before Wednesday’s (1/9) class. If you truly have no questions to ask, just stop by and say hi and introduce yourself.",
